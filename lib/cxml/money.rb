  # The Money element has three possible attributes: currency, alternateAmount,
  # alternateCurrency. The attributes currency and alternateCurrecy must be
  # a three-letter ISO 4217 currency code. The content of the Money element
  # and of the aternateAmount attribute should be a numeric value.
  # For example:
  #   <Money currency="USD">
  #     12.34
  #   </Money>
  # The optional alternateCurrency and alternateAmount attributes are used
  # together to specify an amount in an alternate currency.
  # These can be used to support dual-currency requirements such as the euro.
  # For example:
  #   <Money currency="USD" alternateCurrency="EUR" alternateAmount="14.28">
  #     12.34
  #   </Money>
  # Note:
  #   You can optionally use commas as thousands separators.
  #   Do not use commas as decimal separators.
